Welcome to sgl's documentation!
===============================

Congratulations, you have found the wasteland that is called "sgl
documentation". If you came here by accident, I advise you to leave as
fast as you can. Otherwise you have my deepest condolences! I know how
bad this documentation is and every second you spend here makes you wonder
what you have done to deserve this. I'm sorry!

If you don't even know what sgl is, head over to http://github.com/Kingdread/sgl
and read the README. If you still want to read the documentation then, head on.

If you have found sgl but you don't know what Python is, then I'm kinda
impressed. But fear not! Python is a programming language, more specifically
the language that sgl is written in. The problem is that sgl is not a
standalone program like Firefox for example, sgl is merely a library that other
programs can use. So if you want to use sgl, you have to learn Python, at least
the syntax. It's a very easy to learn language with a huge and nice community!
You can use the `official tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`_
to learn the basics. Maybe one day sgl will be a standalone program, but until
then you can only use it as a library...
